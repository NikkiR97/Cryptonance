CMPE 130 Project

Hello There! Welcome to Cryptonance. It's a project I did with my teammates for my Advanced Algo class (CMPE 130, sjsu).

It's a Cryptocurrency trading app where all the transactions are hashed to a hashtable using the SHA-256 Algorithm.

The app was a developed using the Ionic framework and uses Angular Firebase integration. All the source code is developed in Typescript (just like javascript but provides static typing)
